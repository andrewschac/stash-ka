# Research Proposal: Work from Home's Influence on Employee Opportunities and Performance
## By Jon Trzaska and Andrew Schachter

### Research Question

The inspiration for our final project stems from the wide-ranging work from home(WFH) work done by Nicholas Bloom. We plan to utilize some of the data that he has compiled in his work and apply it to understand how the recent WFH shift has influenced employees' experience in the workplace. Generally, we are asking the following questions:
1. Does WFH contribute to a worse experience for employees in regard to training, development, and integration?
2. What is WFH's effect on employee performance?

We plan to approach these questions by assessing the employees on a macro scale. By this, we mean looking at general trends across time and comparing levels of training/development sentiment and performance to the proportion of WFH employees. Some of the specific questions we are going to answer to assess the impact of WFH on employees include:
1. Is an employee more likely to leave a company if they WFH?
2. Does working for a WFH company increase employee productivity?
3. How is WFH correlated with employee growth opportunities?
