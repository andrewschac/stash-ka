# Research Proposal: Work from Home's Influence on Employee Opportunities and Performance
### By Jon Trzaska and Andrew Schachter

## Research Question

The inspiration for our final project stems from the wide-ranging work from home (WFH) work done by Nicholas Bloom. We plan to utilize some of the data that he has compiled in his work and apply it to understand how the recent WFH shift has influenced employees' experience in the workplace. Generally, we are asking the following questions:
1. Does WFH contribute to a worse experience for employees in regard to training, development, and integration?
2. What is WFH's effect on employee performance?

We plan to approach these questions by assessing the employees on a macro scale. By this, we mean looking at general trends across time and comparing levels of training/development sentiment and performance to the proportion of WFH employees. Some of the specific questions we are going to answer to assess the impact of WFH on employees include:
1. Is an employee more likely to leave a company if they WFH?
2. Does WFH increase employee productivity?
3. How is WFH correlated with employee promotion opportunities? 

In answering these questions, we mostly intend to assess how the levels of variables like productivity are different in times before and after the WFH boom (COVID-19 era). For other variables, like employee retention or promotion opportunities, we plan to compare the correlation of them to the proportion of WFH over time. Our project is wholly meant to explore the relationship between WFH and different variables that quantify employee opportunity and performance. Both of us having experience as students who were forced to learn from home and having WFH work experience in the past, we generally expect the influence of WFH to have a positive impact in most aspects of an employee's experience. Our general hypotheses and corresponding thoughts are outlined below:
- WFH makes an employee more likely to stay with a company
    - *Working from home adds more flexibility to an individual's schedule and reduces unnecessary aspects associated with working (commutes, less time wasted in meetings, monetary savings in regard to food/commute, etc.).*
- WFH increases employee productivity
    - *Employees are more distracted in the workplace and they avoid the downtime that occurs within an office setting.* 
- WFH hinders employees opportunities for growth
    - *With less in-office, face-to-face interaction with superiors, there are less opportunities for employees to be recognized by those who offer promotions and there is less collaboration with other employees.*
    
## Data

Our project assess employee variables on the macro-level, meaning our dataset will be a time-series dataset. Our idea is to combine Nicholas Bloom's WFH dataset that contains the proportion of US workers that WFH with other variables that define employee opportunities and performance. The variables we intend to add to this dataset include the following:
- Turnover - % of US employees who left their firm
- Productivity - Total Factor Productivity
- Employee Growth - ? 
- Promotion Opportunities - % of US employees who elevated to a high position
Though we have access to the overall percentage of the US working population who is WFH, annually, we still need to acquire some of the variable data. We intend to measure employee productivity by utilizing Total Factor Productivity, a measure that is tracked by the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/productivity/data.htm). We are still researching ways to gain access to US turnover and promotion data. In regard to employee growth, we are struggling to find ways to quantify the measures of training, development, and integration.
