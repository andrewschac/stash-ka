    "This dataset describes the land in Ames, IA (city of Iowa State University) that was sold between 2006 and 2008. The observation unit is each parcel of land in the city's jurisdiction that was sold during the given time frame and the dataset contains 1941 observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some immediate issues with the data include variables with missing data. Variables that contain information that not every parcel of land might have have many holes. For example, variables like Misc_Feature (Miscellaneous features not covered in other categories, ex. elevator, shed, tennis court), Pool_QC (Pool quality), and variables that relate to basements or garages have many NaN values because it is understandable that many houses don't have these features. Most of the variables that have NaN values are categorical, this makes sense because most of the discrete values in the dataset relate to either quantity or value. For a categorical value, if a parcel of land does not contain what's in the variable, it will receive a NaN value while its discrete component will instead have a value of zero. So while Pool_QC has a NaN value, Pool_Area would just have a value of zero instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains a vast array of data types throughout. Many discrete variables are what one might expect. Variables that relate to count or date are discrete because they have finite ranges and are countable. Some examples include `['v_Yr_Sold']` (Year sold) or `['v_Fireplaces']` (Number of fireplaces). On the other hand, there are also continuous variables like `['v_Lot_Area']` (Lot size in sq ft.). These variable are continuous because they are much more precise and can be any of infinity numbers within a specified range. Other variables that relate to size, length, area, value, or price are continuous. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest are categorical variables which are further broken down into either nominal or ordinal data. The nominal data describes the specific variable as it relates to each parcel of land, for example, `['v_MS_Zoning']` describes the zoning classification of each parcel and `['v_Street']` describes the type of road access to each parcel (gravel or paved). The ordinal data classifies each variable in a ranking as it relates to each parcel of land. `['v_Pool_Qc']` describes the quality of the pool on each parcel of land (There are many NaN values for this variable). The variable only has five possible values in it: Ex-Excellent, Gd-Good, TA-Typical/Average, Fa-Fair, NA-No Pool. What separates this from the nominal variables is that this variable describes one thing, the pool quality, and *ranks* the characteristics of that one thing. In comparison, in `['v_Street']`, where the two options are \"gravel\" or \"paved\", the variable is not being ranked, it is just being described. \n",
